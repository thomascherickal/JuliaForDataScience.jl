If you are interested in how and why Julia exists at all, a good read by its creators is here: [Why We Created Julia](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia).  Below is  an excerpt:

> We love [Matlab/Lisp/Python/Ruby/Perl/Mathematica/R/C]; they are wonderful and powerful. For the work we do — scientific computing, machine learning, data mining, large-scale linear algebra, distributed and parallel computing — each one is perfect for some aspects of the work and terrible for others. Each one is a trade-off.  We are greedy: we want more.

The reasons why you should use Julia for data science is similar to the reasons why the founders made Julia:

* **Your performance with current tools is lacking.**
  * **Your productiviy with current tools is lacking.**

**Come for the speed, stay for the productivity.**
