# JuliaDB

JuliaDB is a package for working with large persistent data sets

We recognized the need for an all-Julia, end-to-end tool that can

Load multi-dimensional datasets quickly and incrementally.
Index the data and perform filter, aggregate, sort and join operations.
Save results and load them efficiently later.
Use Julia's built-in parallelism to fully utilize any machine or cluster.
We built JuliaDB to fill this void.
